## About :point_down:

<div align="justified">

In this repository I have added all my C programs devided on specific folders according to their topics or implementation. 

</div>


## Purpose :point_down:

<div align="justified">

I have done these programs for practice C programs and implement specific logics for different problem solving related to our works.

# Making :point_down:

<div align="justified">

I have used C proramming language for all these programs. I have implemented the programs with specific logics, ideas and designs.
